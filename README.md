# RESTful API using Java, with Spring Boot

This is a super simple api that implements CRUD operations. It saves data in a Java List<> object, and uses JSON requests to exchange data. 

I wrote this code to learn the basics of working with Spring Boot and building an API in Java, before moving on to something more complex, like connecting to a database.
